        android:text="The other day, I was at the gym practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and I wanted to know whether a new move I had learned was increasing my success rate or decreasing it, and the thought occurred to me that this sort of optimization occurs regularly in software development. A/B tests are a design staple for many large e-commerce sites, so why shouldn't that kind of fine-tuning be used in everyday life?

AvB is an Android mobile app that aims to bring A/B testing optimization to daily life. Potential use cases are myriad: will my golf score improve if I change my swing by adding this flourish? Should I ignore the haters and bowl grandma-style with two hands between my legs? If I add this card to my Magic deck, will it increase my win rate? If I make students sign the honor code before taking the exam, will the rate of cheating decrease?, Does treating my honeybees for _Varroa_ mites really make a difference?, etc., etc.

AvB leverages (Bayesian?) statistical model x to perform significance tests and statistical model y to perform power tests (for an approximation of how many trials are necessary to detect statistical significance for a given effect size)...
